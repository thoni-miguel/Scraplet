## Scraplet

**Scraplet** is a minimal CLI tool to extract elements from any webpage using CSS selectors.  
Point it at a URL, tell it what HTML tag or class to look for, and get the results.

⚠️  
Scraplet is designed for public, static websites without anti-scraping protections or heavy JavaScript.
For more advanced scraping (like dynamic content), a Playwright-powered version is planned.
